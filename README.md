 AI AutoRemesh â€“ Instant Meshes Integration for Blender
Overview
AI AutoRemesh is a powerful Blender addon that directly integrates the open-source technology of Instant Meshes into Blender.
It enables you to generate high-quality Field Aligned Remeshes within seconds â€” perfect for retopology, game assets, and optimized sculpting workflows.

Main Features
Direct remesh workflow inside Blender (no external exports needed)

Fast field-aligned remeshing based on feature detection

Preview mode (planned for future versions)

Automatic download and management of the Instant Meshes Engine

User-friendly UI Panel in the Blender sidebar (N-Panel)

Batch remesh for multiple objects (planned)

What is Field Aligned Remeshing?
Field-aligned remeshing creates a new mesh topology that follows the natural shapes and curvatures of the model.
Instead of generating random triangles (like Dyntopo or Voxel Remesh), it produces:

Edges aligned along important features (creases, curves, sharp angles)

Cleanly structured quads or tris

Optimized UV unwrapping and better animation results

This method is especially useful for:

Character modeling

Game asset creation

Technical models

Sculpting or baking preparation
